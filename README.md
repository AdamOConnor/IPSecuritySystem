# IPSecuritySystem
A Java application with documentation on a OpenCv based security camera application.

# What the project intails

This project in hand takes on the view of a software developer, who can take Hardware such as an off the shelf web camera, Raspberry Pi and coding knowledge. The developer can implement these technologies and allow access to a live video stream from specific IP cameras or (“Project”) which is set up in a specific area. The remote access to the camera can be viewed from any web browser as long as the client/user has internet connection.
The project also incorporates advanced image processing detection that records data that is inconsistent with the daily environment in which the device is placed.
The project solution demonstrates the use of the OpenCv libraries with Java. Producing a fully functional streaming IP Camera made from a Raspberry Pi and a store bought web camera, the device uses MJPG as a streaming method across a wide area network or local network.
The camera provides a convenient monitoring system that is easy to use and when you’re on the go email alerts along with an image or video snippet of the abnormality that has been captured. 
The smart cam is a developers dream as he can see what’s going on in the home or outside the home without even being in the same vicinity.  With the technology based into two separate packages the project produces a more convenient way of making sure your home is safe.
With the growth of these devices and as such the IOT or (“Internet of things”) the project fits in hand with the current technologies in this day and age and another way to keep the home safe.
